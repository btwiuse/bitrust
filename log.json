    "message": "Auto merge of #27307 - rkruppe:dec2flt, r=pnkfelix\n\nCompletely rewrite the conversion of decimal strings to `f64` and `f32`. The code is intended to be absolutely positively completely 100% accurate (when it doesn't give up). To the best of my knowledge, it achieves that goal. Any input that is not rejected is converted to the floating point number that is closest to the true value of the input. This includes overflow, subnormal numbers, and underflow to zero. In other words, the rounding error is less than or equal to 0.5 units in the last place. Half-way cases (exactly 0.5 ULP error) are handled with half-to-even rounding, also known as banker's rounding.\r\n\r\nThis code implements the algorithms from the paper [How to Read Floating Point Numbers Accurately][paper] by William D. Clinger, with extensions to handle underflow, overflow and subnormals, as well as some algorithmic optimizations.\r\n\r\n# Correctness\r\n\r\nWith such a large amount of tricky code, many bugs are to be expected. Indeed tracking down the obscure causes of various rounding errors accounts for the bulk of the development time. Extensive tests (taking in the order of hours to run through to completion) are included in `src/etc/test-float-parse`: Though exhaustively testing all possible inputs is impossible, I've had good success with generating millions of instances from various \"classes\" of inputs. These tests take far too long to be run by @bors so contributors who touch this code need the discipline to run them. There are `#[test]`s, but they don't even cover every stupid mistake I made in course of writing this.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect is *integer* overflow. Extreme (or malicious) inputs could cause overflow both in the machine-sized integers used for bookkeeping throughout the algorithms (e.g., the decimal exponent) as well as the arbitrary-precision arithmetic. There is input validation to reject all such cases I know of, and I am quite sure nobody will *accidentally* cause this code to go out of range. Still, no guarantees.\r\n\r\n# Limitations\r\n\r\nNoticed the weasel words \"(when it doesn't give up)\" at the beginning? Some otherwise well-formed decimal strings are rejected because spelling out the value of the input requires too many digits, i.e., `digits * 10^abs(exp)` can't be stored in a bignum. This only applies if the value is not \"obviously\" zero or infinite, i.e., if you take a near-infinity or near-zero value and add many pointless fractional digits. At least with the algorithm used here, computing the precise value would require computing the full value as a fraction, which would overflow. The precise limit is `number_of_digits + abs(exp) > 375` but could be raised almost arbitrarily. In the future, another algorithm might lift this restriction entirely.\r\n\r\nThis should not be an issue for any realistic inputs. Still, the code does reject inputs that would result in a finite float when evaluated with unlimited precision. Some of these inputs are even regressions that the old code (mostly) handled, such as `0.333...333` with 400+ `3`s. Thus this might qualify as [breaking-change].\r\n\r\n# Performance\r\n\r\nBenchmarks results are... tolerable. Short numbers that hit the fast paths (`f64` multiplication or shortcuts to zero/inf) have performance in the same order of magnitude as the old code tens of nanoseconds. Numbers that are delegated to Algorithm Bellerophon (using floats with 64 bit significand, implemented in software) are slower, but not drastically so (couple hundred nanoseconds).\r\n\r\nNumbers that need the AlgorithmM fallback (for `f64`, roughly everything below 1e-305 and above 1e305) take far, far longer, hundreds of microseconds. Note that my implementation is not quite as naive as the expository version in the paper (it needs one to four division instead of ~1000), but division is fundamentally pretty expensive and my implementation of it is extremely simple and slow.\r\n\r\nAll benchmarks run on a mediocre laptop with a i5-4200U CPU under light load.\r\n\r\n# Binary size\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the implementation needs to duplicate almost all code: Once for `f32` and once for `f64`. Before you ask, no, this cannot be avoided, at least not completely (but see the Future Work section). There's also a precomputed table of powers of ten, weighing in at about six kilobytes.\r\n\r\nRunning a stage1 `rustc` over a stand-alone program that simply parses pi to `f32` and `f64` and outputs both results reveals that the overhead vs. the old parsing code is about 44 KiB normally and about 28 KiB with LTO. It's presumably half of that + 3 KiB when only one of the two code paths is exercised.\r\n\r\n| rustc options                 | old       | new       | delta         |\r\n|---------------------------    |---------  |---------  |-----------    |\r\n| [nothing]                     | 2588375   | 2633828   | 44.39 KiB     |\r\n| -O                            | 2585211   | 2630688   | 44.41 KiB     |\r\n| -O -C lto                     | 1026353   | 1054981   | 27.96 KiB     |\r\n| -O -C lto -C link-args=-s     | 414208    | 442368    | 27.5 KiB      |\r\n\r\n# Future Work\r\n\r\n## Directory layout\r\n\r\nThe `dec2flt` code uses some types embedded deeply in the `flt2dec` module hierarchy, even though nothing about them it formatting-specific.

Another avenue would be reducing the code duplication from basically everything being generic over `T: RawFloat`.

But, once a path has a hint, we must at least maintain it: i.e. if the hint exists, we must ensure it is never set to \"moved\" if the data in question might actually have been initialized. It remains sound to conservatively set the hint to \"initialized\" as long as the true drop-flag embedded in the value itself is up-to-date.\r\n\r\nI hope the commit series has been broken up to be readable; most of the commits in the series should build (though I did not always check this).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nOh, I think this technically qualifies as a:\r\n[breaking-change]\r\nbecause it removes drop-filling in some cases where one could previously observe it.

For an example of code that needed to change to account for this, see commit a81c24ae0216ab47df59acd724f8a33124fb6d97 (a unit test of the `move_val_init` intrinsic).  I have not encountered actual code that needed to be updated to account for the change, since this should only be skipping the drop-filling on *moved* values, not on dropped one, and so even types that use `unsafe_no_drop_flag` should be unchanged by this particular PR. (Their time will come later.)"

This patch adds a simple global to the tcx to cache such cases. The main advantage of this is really about caching things like `Box<Vec<Foo>>: Sized`. It also points to the need to revamp our caching infrastructure -- the current caches make selection cost cheaper, but we still wind up paying a high cost in the confirmation process, and in particular unrolling out dependent obligations. Moreover, we should probably do caching more uniformly and with a key that takes the where-clauses into account. But that's for later.\r\n\r\nFor me, this shows up as a reasonably nice win (20%) on Servo's script crate (when built in dev mode). This is not as big as my initial measurements suggested, I think because I was building my rustc with more debugging enabled at the time. I've not yet done follow-up profiling and so forth to see where the new hot spots are. Bootstrap times seem to be largely unaffected.\r\n\r\ncc @pcwalton \r\n\r\nThis is technically a [breaking-change] in that functions with unsatisfiable where-clauses may now yield errors where before they may have been accepted. Even before, these functions could never have been *called* by actual code. In the future, such functions will probably become illegal altogether, but in this commit they are still accepted, so long as they do not rely on the unsatisfiable where-clauses. As before, the functions still cannot be called in any case."

In brief,\r\n\r\n* This adds a new hidden module `core::num::flt2dec` for testing from `libcoretest`. Why is it in `core::num` instead of `core::fmt`? Because I envision that the table used by `flt2dec` is directly applicable to `dec2flt` (cf. #24557) as well, which exceeds the realm of \"formatting\".\r\n* This contains both Dragon4 algorithm (exact, complete but slow) and Grisu3 algorithm (exact, fast but incomplete).\r\n* The code is accompanied with a large amount of self-tests and some exhaustive tests. In particular, `libcoretest` gets a new dependency on `librand`. For the external interface it relies on the existing test suite.\r\n* It is known that, in the best case, the entire formatting code has about 30 KBs of binary overhead (judged from strconv experiments). Not too bad but there might be a potential room for improvements.\r\n\r\nThis is rather large code.

    "message": "dropck: must assume `Box<Trait + 'a>` has a destructor of interest.\n\nImplements this (previously overlooked) note from [RFC 769]:\n\n> (Note: When encountering a D of the form `Box<Trait+'b>`, we\n> conservatively assume that such a type has a Drop implementation\n> parametric in 'b.)\n\nFix #25199.\n\n[breaking-change]\n\nThe breakage here falls into both obvious and non-obvious cases.\n\nThe obvious case: if you were relying on the unsoundness this exposes\n(namely being able to reference dead storage from a destructor, by\ndoing it via a boxed trait object bounded by the lifetime of the dead\nstorage), then this change disallows that.\n\nThe non-obvious cases: The way dropck works, it causes lifetimes to be\nextended to longer extents than they covered before. I.e.  lifetimes\nthat are attached as trait-bounds may become longer than they were\npreviously.\n\n* This includes lifetimes that are only *implicitly* attached as\n  trait-bounds (due to [RFC 599]). So you may have code that was\n  e.g. taking a parameter of type `&'a Box<Trait>` (which expands to\n  `&'a Box<Trait+'a>`), that now may need to be assigned type `&'a\n  Box<Trait+'static>` to ensure that `'a` is not inadvertantly\n  inferred to a region that is actually too long.

    "message": "std: Set CLOEXEC for all fds opened on unix\n\nThis commit starts to set the CLOEXEC flag for all files and sockets opened by\nthe standard library by default on all unix platforms. There are a few points of\nnote in this commit:\n\n* The implementation is not 100% satisfactory in the face of threads. File\n  descriptors only have the `F_CLOEXEC` flag set *after* they are opened,\n  allowing for a fork/exec to happen in the middle and leak the descriptor.\n  Some platforms do support atomically opening a descriptor while setting the\n  `CLOEXEC` flag, and it is left as a future extension to bind these apis as it\n  is unclear how to do so nicely at this time.\n\n* The implementation does not offer a method of opting into the old behavior of\n  not setting `CLOEXEC`. This will possibly be added in the future through\n  extensions on `OpenOptions`, for example.\n\n* This change does not yet audit any Windows APIs to see if the handles are\n  inherited by default by accident.\n\nThis is a breaking change for users who call `fork` or `exec` outside of the\nstandard library itself and expect file descriptors to be inherted. All file\ndescriptors created by the standard library will no longer be inherited.\n\n[breaking-change]"
