The child is automatically detached when the\n  handle is dropped, and the handle cannot be copied due to Posix\n  semantics.\n\n* It moves all static methods from `std::thread::Thread` to free\n  functions in `std::thread`. This was done in part because, due to the\n  above changes, there are effectively no direct `Thread` constructors,\n  and the static methods have tended to feel a bit awkward.\n\n* Adds an `io::Result` around the `Builder` methods `scoped` and\n  `spawn`, making it possible to handle OS errors when creating\n  threads. The convenience free functions entail an unwrap.\n\n* Stabilizes the entire module. Despite the fact that the API is\n  changing somewhat here, this is part of a long period of baking and\n  the changes are addressing all known issues prior to alpha2. If\n  absolutely necessary, further breaking changes can be made prior to beta.\n\nCloses #20807\n\n[breaking-change]"

The older scheme defaulted objects in argument\nposition so that they were bounded by a fresh lifetime:\n\n```rust\nfn foo<'a>(..., object: Box<FnMut()+'a>)\n```\n\nThis meant that the object could contain borrowed data. The newer\nscheme defaults to a lifetime bound of `'static`:\n\n```rust\nfn foo(..., object: Box<FnMut()+'static>)\n```\n\nThis means that the object cannot contain borrowed data. In some cases, the best fix\nis to stop using `Box`:\n\n```rust\nfn foo(..., object: &mut FnMut())\n```\n\nbut another option is to write an explicit annotation for the `'a`\nlifetime that used to be implicit.

    "message": "std: Stabilize the std::fmt module\n\nThis commit performs a final stabilization pass over the std::fmt module,\nmarking all necessary APIs as stable. One of the more interesting aspects of\nthis module is that it exposes a good deal of its runtime representation to the\noutside world in order for `format_args!` to be able to construct the format\nstrings. Instead of hacking the compiler to assume that these items are stable,\nthis commit instead lays out a story for the stabilization and evolution of\nthese APIs.\n\nThere are three primary details used by the `format_args!` macro:\n\n1. `Arguments` - an opaque package of a \"compiled format string\". This structure\n   is passed around and the `write` function is the source of truth for\n   transforming a compiled format string into a string at runtime. This must be\n   able to be constructed in stable code.\n\n2. `Argument` - an opaque structure representing an argument to a format string.\n   This is *almost* a trait object as it's just a pointer/function pair, but due\n   to the function originating from one of many traits, it's not actually a\n   trait object. Like `Arguments`, this must be constructed from stable code.\n\n3. `fmt::rt` - this module contains the runtime type definitions primarily for\n   the `rt::Argument` structure. Whenever an argument is formatted with\n   nonstandard flags, a corresponding `rt::Argument` is generated describing how\n   the argument is being formatted. This can be used to construct an\n   `Arguments`.\n\nThe primary interface to `std::fmt` is the `Arguments` structure, and as such\nthis type name is stabilize as-is today. It is expected for libraries to pass\naround an `Arguments` structure to represent a pending formatted computation.\n\nThe remaining portions are largely \"cruft\" which would rather not be stabilized,\nbut due to the stability checks they must be. As a result, almost all pieces\nhave been renamed to represent that they are \"version 1\" of the formatting\nrepresentation. The theory is that at a later date if we change the\nrepresentation of these types we can add new definitions called \"version 2\" and\ncorresponding constructors for `Arguments`.\n\nOne of the other remaining large questions about the fmt module were how the\npending I/O reform would affect the signatures of methods in the module. Due to\n[RFC 526][rfc], however, the writers of fmt are now incompatible with the\nwriters of io, so this question has largely been solved. As a result the\ninterfaces are largely stabilized as-is today.\n\n[rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0526-fmt-text-writer.md\n\nSpecifically, the following changes were made:\n\n* The contents of `fmt::rt` were all moved under `fmt::rt::v1`\n* `fmt::rt` is stable\n* `fmt::rt::v1` is stable\n* `Error` is stable\n* `Writer` is stable\n* `Writer::write_str` is stable\n* `Writer::write_fmt` is stable\n* `Formatter` is stable\n* `Argument` has been renamed to `ArgumentV1` and is stable\n* `ArgumentV1::new` is stable\n* `ArgumentV1::from_uint` is stable\n* `Arguments::new_v1` is stable (renamed from `new`)\n* `Arguments::new_v1_formatted` is stable (renamed from `with_placeholders`)\n* All formatting traits are now stable, as well as the `fmt` method.\n* `fmt::write` is stable\n* `fmt::format` is stable\n* `Formatter::pad_integral` is stable\n* `Formatter::pad` is stable\n* `Formatter::write_str` is stable\n* `Formatter::write_fmt` is stable\n* Some assorted top level items which were only used by `format_args!` were\n  removed in favor of static functions on `ArgumentV1` as well.\n* The formatting-flag-accessing methods remain unstable\n\nWithin the contents of the `fmt::rt::v1` module, the following actions were\ntaken:\n\n* Reexports of all enum variants were removed\n* All prefixes on enum variants were removed\n* A few miscellaneous enum variants were renamed\n* Otherwise all structs, fields, and variants were marked stable.\n\nIn addition to these actions in the `std::fmt` module, many implementations of\n`Show` and `String` were stabilized as well.\n\nIn some other modules:\n\n* `ToString` is now stable\n* `ToString::to_string` is now stable\n* `Vec` no longer implements `fmt::Writer` (this has moved to `String`)\n\nThis is a breaking change due to all of the changes to the `fmt::rt` module, but\nthis likely will not have much impact on existing programs.\n\nCloses #20661\n[breaking-change]"
