This PR adds a lint warning unless the \"type-parameter-defaults\" feature is enabled. This should eventually become a hard error.\n\nThis is a [breaking-change] in that new feature gates are required (or simply removing the defaults, which is probably a better choice as they have little effect at this time). Results of a [crater run][crater] suggest that approximately 5-15 crates are affected. I didn't do the measurement quite right so that run cannot distinguish \"true\" regressions from \"non-root\" regressions, but even the upper bound of 15 affected crates seems relatively minimal.\n\n[crater]: https://gist.github.com/nikomatsakis/760c6a67698bd24253bf\n\ncc @rust-lang/lang\nr? @pnkfelix"

    "message": "Auto merge of #30532 - nikomatsakis:cross-item-dependencies, r=mw\n\nThis is roughly the same as my previous PR that created a dependency graph, but that:\n\n1. The dependency graph is only optionally constructed, though this doesn't seem to make much of a difference in terms of overhead (see measurements below).\n2. The dependency graph is simpler (I combined a lot of nodes).\n3. The dependency graph debugging facilities are much better: you can now use `RUST_DEP_GRAPH_FILTER` to filter the dep graph to just the nodes you are interested in, which is super help.\n4. The tests are somewhat more elaborate, including a few known bugs I need to fix in a second pass.\n\nThis is potentially a `[breaking-change]` for plugin authors. If you are poking about in tcx state or something like that, you probably want to add `let _ignore = tcx.dep_graph.in_ignore();`, which will cause your reads/writes to be ignored and not affect the dep-graph.\n\nAfter this, or perhaps as an add-on to this PR in some cases, what I would like to do is the following:\n\n- [x] Write-up a little guide to how to use this system, the debugging options available, and what the possible failure modes are.\n- [ ] Introduce read-only and perhaps the `Meta` node\n- [x] Replace \"memoization tasks\" with node from the map itself\n- [ ] Fix the shortcomings, obviously! Notably, the HIR map needs to register reads, and there is some state that is not yet tracked. (Maybe as a separate PR.)\n- [x] Refactor the dep-graph code so that the actual maintenance of the dep-graph occurs in a parallel thread, and the main thread simply throws things into a shared channel (probably a fixed-size channel). There is no reason for dep-graph construction to be on the main thread. (Maybe as a separate PR.)\n\nRegarding performance: adding this tracking does add some overhead, approximately 2% in my measurements (I was comparing the build times for rustdoc). Interestingly, enabling or disabling tracking doesn't seem to do very much. I want to poke at this some more and gather a bit more data -- in some tests I've seen that 2% go away, but on others it comes back. It's not entirely clear to me if that 2% is truly due to constructing the dep-graph at all.\n\nThe next big step after this is write some code to dump the dep-graph to disk and reload it.\n\nr? @michaelwoerister"

They are also *mostly* independent from ordering, so e.g. reordering two functions will change the defids, but it will not change the paths that they expand into (but this is not the case for some things, such as impls).\r\n\r\nThis is a major refactoring, so I did it in slices. The final commit is in some sense The Big One where most of the work is done. The earlier commits just pave the way by gradually refactoring accesses to the `node` field.\r\n\r\nThis is a [breaking-change] for plugin authors. The things you need to do to migrate your code are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. For local def-ids, rather than do `def_id.node`, call `tcx.map.as_local_node_id(def_id)`.\r\n2. To construct a local def-id, call `tcx.map.local_def_id(node_id)`.\r\n3. Note that you cannot make def-ids for any node, but only for \"definitions\" -- which include all items, as well as a number of other things, but not e.g. arbitrary expressions.\r\n4. You can get the path to a def-id by calling `tcx.def_path(def_id)`.\r\n\r\nOne thing that is NOT part of this PR, but which I plan do in a follow-up, is converting uses of the existing `with_path` API to use `def_path`, which is basically the same.\r\n\r\nr? @eddyb (or @nrc)"

    "message": "Auto merge of #27307 - rkruppe:dec2flt, r=pnkfelix\n\nCompletely rewrite the conversion of decimal strings to `f64` and `f32`. The code is intended to be absolutely positively completely 100% accurate (when it doesn't give up). To the best of my knowledge, it achieves that goal. Any input that is not rejected is converted to the floating point number that is closest to the true value of the input. This includes overflow, subnormal numbers, and underflow to zero. In other words, the rounding error is less than or equal to 0.5 units in the last place. Half-way cases (exactly 0.5 ULP error) are handled with half-to-even rounding, also known as banker's rounding.\r\n\r\nThis code implements the algorithms from the paper [How to Read Floating Point Numbers Accurately][paper] by William D. Clinger, with extensions to handle underflow, overflow and subnormals, as well as some algorithmic optimizations.\r\n\r\n# Correctness\r\n\r\nWith such a large amount of tricky code, many bugs are to be expected. Indeed tracking down the obscure causes of various rounding errors accounts for the bulk of the development time. Extensive tests (taking in the order of hours to run through to completion) are included in `src/etc/test-float-parse`: Though exhaustively testing all possible inputs is impossible, I've had good success with generating millions of instances from various \"classes\" of inputs. These tests take far too long to be run by @bors so contributors who touch this code need the discipline to run them. There are `#[test]`s, but they don't even cover every stupid mistake I made in course of writing this.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect is *integer* overflow. Extreme (or malicious) inputs could cause overflow both in the machine-sized integers used for bookkeeping throughout the algorithms (e.g., the decimal exponent) as well as the arbitrary-precision arithmetic. There is input validation to reject all such cases I know of, and I am quite sure nobody will *accidentally* cause this code to go out of range. Still, no guarantees.\r\n\r\n# Limitations\r\n\r\nNoticed the weasel words \"(when it doesn't give up)\" at the beginning? Some otherwise well-formed decimal strings are rejected because spelling out the value of the input requires too many digits, i.e., `digits * 10^abs(exp)` can't be stored in a bignum. This only applies if the value is not \"obviously\" zero or infinite, i.e., if you take a near-infinity or near-zero value and add many pointless fractional digits. At least with the algorithm used here, computing the precise value would require computing the full value as a fraction, which would overflow. The precise limit is `number_of_digits + abs(exp) > 375` but could be raised almost arbitrarily. In the future, another algorithm might lift this restriction entirely.\r\n\r\nThis should not be an issue for any realistic inputs. Still, the code does reject inputs that would result in a finite float when evaluated with unlimited precision. Some of these inputs are even regressions that the old code (mostly) handled, such as `0.333...333` with 400+ `3`s. Thus this might qualify as [breaking-change].\r\n\r\n# Performance\r\n\r\nBenchmarks results are... tolerable. Short numbers that hit the fast paths (`f64` multiplication or shortcuts to zero/inf) have performance in the same order of magnitude as the old code tens of nanoseconds. Numbers that are delegated to Algorithm Bellerophon (using floats with 64 bit significand, implemented in software) are slower, but not drastically so (couple hundred nanoseconds).\r\n\r\nNumbers that need the AlgorithmM fallback (for `f64`, roughly everything below 1e-305 and above 1e305) take far, far longer, hundreds of microseconds. Note that my implementation is not quite as naive as the expository version in the paper (it needs one to four division instead of ~1000), but division is fundamentally pretty expensive and my implementation of it is extremely simple and slow.\r\n\r\nAll benchmarks run on a mediocre laptop with a i5-4200U CPU under light load.\r\n\r\n# Binary size\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the implementation needs to duplicate almost all code: Once for `f32` and once for `f64`. Before you ask, no, this cannot be avoided, at least not completely (but see the Future Work section). There's also a precomputed table of powers of ten, weighing in at about six kilobytes.\r\n\r\nRunning a stage1 `rustc` over a stand-alone program that simply parses pi to `f32` and `f64` and outputs both results reveals that the overhead vs. the old parsing code is about 44 KiB normally and about 28 KiB with LTO. It's presumably half of that + 3 KiB when only one of the two code paths is exercised.\r\n\r\n| rustc options                 | old       | new       | delta         |\r\n|---------------------------    |---------  |---------  |-----------    |\r\n| [nothing]                     | 2588375   | 2633828   | 44.39 KiB     |\r\n| -O                            | 2585211   | 2630688   | 44.41 KiB     |\r\n| -O -C lto                     | 1026353   | 1054981   | 27.96 KiB     |\r\n| -O -C lto -C link-args=-s     | 414208    | 442368    | 27.5 KiB      |\r\n\r\n# Future Work\r\n\r\n## Directory layout\r\n\r\nThe `dec2flt` code uses some types embedded deeply in the `flt2dec` module hierarchy, even though nothing about them it formatting-specific.

Some low-hanging fruit has been picked but much more work could be done. Some specific ideas are jotted down in `FIXME`s all over the code.\r\n\r\n## Binary size\r\n\r\nOne could try to compress the table further, though I am skeptical. Another avenue would be reducing the code duplication from basically everything being generic over `T: RawFloat`. Perhaps one can reduce the magnitude of the duplication by pushing the parts that don't need to know the target type into separate functions, but this is finicky and probably makes some code read less naturally.\r\n\r\n## Other bases\r\n\r\nThis PR leaves `f{32,64}::from_str_radix` alone. It only replaces `FromStr` (and thus `.parse()`). I am convinced that `from_str_radix` should not exist, and have proposed its [deprecation and speedy removal][deprecate-radix].

It remains sound to conservatively set the hint to \"initialized\" as long as the true drop-flag embedded in the value itself is up-to-date.\r\n\r\nI hope the commit series has been broken up to be readable; most of the commits in the series should build (though I did not always check this).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nOh, I think this technically qualifies as a:\r\n[breaking-change]\r\nbecause it removes drop-filling in some cases where one could previously observe it. That should only affect `unsafe` code; no safe code should be able to inspect whether the drop-fill was present or not. For an example of code that needed to change to account for this, see commit a81c24ae0216ab47df59acd724f8a33124fb6d97 (a unit test of the `move_val_init` intrinsic).  I have not encountered actual code that needed to be updated to account for the change, since this should only be skipping the drop-filling on *moved* values, not on dropped one, and so even types that use `unsafe_no_drop_flag` should be unchanged by this particular PR. (Their time will come later.)"

This patch adds a simple global to the tcx to cache such cases. The main advantage of this is really about caching things like `Box<Vec<Foo>>: Sized`. It also points to the need to revamp our caching infrastructure -- the current caches make selection cost cheaper, but we still wind up paying a high cost in the confirmation process, and in particular unrolling out dependent obligations. Moreover, we should probably do caching more uniformly and with a key that takes the where-clauses into account. But that's for later.\r\n\r\nFor me, this shows up as a reasonably nice win (20%) on Servo's script crate (when built in dev mode). This is not as big as my initial measurements suggested, I think because I was building my rustc with more debugging enabled at the time. I've not yet done follow-up profiling and so forth to see where the new hot spots are. Bootstrap times seem to be largely unaffected.\r\n\r\ncc @pcwalton \r\n\r\nThis is technically a [breaking-change] in that functions with unsatisfiable where-clauses may now yield errors where before they may have been accepted. Even before, these functions could never have been *called* by actual code. In the future, such functions will probably become illegal altogether, but in this commit they are still accepted, so long as they do not rely on the unsatisfiable where-clauses. As before, the functions still cannot be called in any case."

The detailed description is available [here](https://github.com/lifthrasiir/rust-strconv#flt2dec). In brief,\r\n\r\n* This adds a new hidden module `core::num::flt2dec` for testing from `libcoretest`. Why is it in `core::num` instead of `core::fmt`? Because I envision that the table used by `flt2dec` is directly applicable to `dec2flt` (cf. #24557) as well, which exceeds the realm of \"formatting\".\r\n* This contains both Dragon4 algorithm (exact, complete but slow) and Grisu3 algorithm (exact, fast but incomplete).\r\n* The code is accompanied with a large amount of self-tests and some exhaustive tests. In particular, `libcoretest` gets a new dependency on `librand`. For the external interface it relies on the existing test suite.\r\n* It is known that, in the best case, the entire formatting code has about 30 KBs of binary overhead (judged from strconv experiments). Not too bad but there might be a potential room for improvements.\r\n\r\nThis is rather large code.
