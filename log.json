This\n  is somewhat less flexible, in that each borrowed type must have a\n  unique owned type, but leads to a significant simplification for\n  `Cow`. Flexibility can be regained by using newtyped slices, which is\n  advisable for other reasons anyway.\n\n* It removes the owned type parameter from `Cow`, making the type much\n  less verbose.\n\n* Deprecates the `is_owned` and `is_borrowed` predicates in favor of\n  direct matching.\n\nThe above API changes are relatively minor; the basic functionality\nremains the same, and essentially the whole module is now marked\n`#[stable]`.\n\n[breaking-change]"

The child is automatically detached when the\n  handle is dropped, and the handle cannot be copied due to Posix\n  semantics.\n\n* It moves all static methods from `std::thread::Thread` to free\n  functions in `std::thread`. This was done in part because, due to the\n  above changes, there are effectively no direct `Thread` constructors,\n  and the static methods have tended to feel a bit awkward.\n\n* Adds an `io::Result` around the `Builder` methods `scoped` and\n  `spawn`, making it possible to handle OS errors when creating\n  threads. The convenience free functions entail an unwrap.\n\n* Stabilizes the entire module. Despite the fact that the API is\n  changing somewhat here, this is part of a long period of baking and\n  the changes are addressing all known issues prior to alpha2.
