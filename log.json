    "message": "std: Stabilize the std::fmt module\n\nThis commit performs a final stabilization pass over the std::fmt module,\nmarking all necessary APIs as stable. One of the more interesting aspects of\nthis module is that it exposes a good deal of its runtime representation to the\noutside world in order for `format_args!` to be able to construct the format\nstrings. Instead of hacking the compiler to assume that these items are stable,\nthis commit instead lays out a story for the stabilization and evolution of\nthese APIs.\n\nThere are three primary details used by the `format_args!` macro:\n\n1. `Arguments` - an opaque package of a \"compiled format string\". This structure\n   is passed around and the `write` function is the source of truth for\n   transforming a compiled format string into a string at runtime. This must be\n   able to be constructed in stable code.\n\n2. `Argument` - an opaque structure representing an argument to a format string.\n   This is *almost* a trait object as it's just a pointer/function pair, but due\n   to the function originating from one of many traits, it's not actually a\n   trait object. Like `Arguments`, this must be constructed from stable code.\n\n3. `fmt::rt` - this module contains the runtime type definitions primarily for\n   the `rt::Argument` structure. Whenever an argument is formatted with\n   nonstandard flags, a corresponding `rt::Argument` is generated describing how\n   the argument is being formatted. This can be used to construct an\n   `Arguments`.\n\nThe primary interface to `std::fmt` is the `Arguments` structure, and as such\nthis type name is stabilize as-is today. It is expected for libraries to pass\naround an `Arguments` structure to represent a pending formatted computation.\n\nThe remaining portions are largely \"cruft\" which would rather not be stabilized,\nbut due to the stability checks they must be. As a result, almost all pieces\nhave been renamed to represent that they are \"version 1\" of the formatting\nrepresentation. The theory is that at a later date if we change the\nrepresentation of these types we can add new definitions called \"version 2\" and\ncorresponding constructors for `Arguments`.\n\nOne of the other remaining large questions about the fmt module were how the\npending I/O reform would affect the signatures of methods in the module. Due to\n[RFC 526][rfc], however, the writers of fmt are now incompatible with the\nwriters of io, so this question has largely been solved. As a result the\ninterfaces are largely stabilized as-is today.\n\n[rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0526-fmt-text-writer.md\n\nSpecifically, the following changes were made:\n\n* The contents of `fmt::rt` were all moved under `fmt::rt::v1`\n* `fmt::rt` is stable\n* `fmt::rt::v1` is stable\n* `Error` is stable\n* `Writer` is stable\n* `Writer::write_str` is stable\n* `Writer::write_fmt` is stable\n* `Formatter` is stable\n* `Argument` has been renamed to `ArgumentV1` and is stable\n* `ArgumentV1::new` is stable\n* `ArgumentV1::from_uint` is stable\n* `Arguments::new_v1` is stable (renamed from `new`)\n* `Arguments::new_v1_formatted` is stable (renamed from `with_placeholders`)\n* All formatting traits are now stable, as well as the `fmt` method.\n* `fmt::write` is stable\n* `fmt::format` is stable\n* `Formatter::pad_integral` is stable\n* `Formatter::pad` is stable\n* `Formatter::write_str` is stable\n* `Formatter::write_fmt` is stable\n* Some assorted top level items which were only used by `format_args!` were\n  removed in favor of static functions on `ArgumentV1` as well.\n* The formatting-flag-accessing methods remain unstable\n\nWithin the contents of the `fmt::rt::v1` module, the following actions were\ntaken:\n\n* Reexports of all enum variants were removed\n* All prefixes on enum variants were removed\n* A few miscellaneous enum variants were renamed\n* Otherwise all structs, fields, and variants were marked stable.\n\nIn addition to these actions in the `std::fmt` module, many implementations of\n`Show` and `String` were stabilized as well.\n\nIn some other modules:\n\n* `ToString` is now stable\n* `ToString::to_string` is now stable\n* `Vec` no longer implements `fmt::Writer` (this has moved to `String`)\n\nThis is a breaking change due to all of the changes to the `fmt::rt` module, but\nthis likely will not have much impact on existing programs.\n\nCloses #20661\n[breaking-change]"

    "message": "rustc: Fix a leak in dependency= paths\n\nWith the addition of separate search paths to the compiler, it was intended that\napplications such as Cargo could require a `--extern` flag per `extern crate`\ndirective in the source. The system can currently be subverted, however, due to\nthe `existing_match()` logic in the crate loader.\n\nWhen loading crates we first attempt to match an `extern crate` directive\nagainst all previously loaded crates to avoid reading metadata twice. This \"hit\nthe cache if possible\" step was erroneously leaking crates across the search\npath boundaries, however. For example:\n\n    extern crate b;\n    extern crate a;\n\nIf `b` depends on `a`, then it will load crate `a` when the `extern crate b`\ndirective is being processed. When the compiler reaches `extern crate a` it will\nuse the previously loaded version no matter what. If the compiler was not\ninvoked with `-L crate=path/to/a`, it will still succeed.\n\nThis behavior is allowing `extern crate` declarations in Cargo without a\ncorresponding declaration in the manifest of a dependency, which is considered\na bug.\n\nThis commit fixes this problem by keeping track of the origin search path for a\ncrate. Crates loaded from the dependency search path are not candidates for\ncrates which are loaded from the crate search path.\n\nAs a result of this fix, this is a likely a breaking change for a number of\nCargo packages.

    "message": "rollup merge of #20654: alexcrichton/stabilize-hash\n\nThis commit aims to prepare the `std::hash` module for alpha by formalizing its\ncurrent interface whileholding off on adding `#[stable]` to the new APIs.  The\ncurrent usage with the `HashMap` and `HashSet` types is also reconciled by\nseparating out composable parts of the design. The primary goal of this slight\nredesign is to separate the concepts of a hasher's state from a hashing\nalgorithm itself.\n\nThe primary change of this commit is to separate the `Hasher` trait into a\n`Hasher` and a `HashState` trait. Conceptually the old `Hasher` trait was\nactually just a factory for various states, but hashing had very little control\nover how these states were used.

The\ncurrent usage with the `HashMap` and `HashSet` types is also reconciled by\nseparating out composable parts of the design.

    "message": "Implement new orphan rule that requires that impls of remote traits meet the following two criteria:\n\n- the self type includes some local type; and,\n- type parameters in the self type must be constrained by a local type.\n\nA type parameter is called *constrained* if it appears in some type-parameter of a local type.\n\nHere are some examples that are accepted. In all of these examples, I\nassume that `Foo` is a trait defined in another crate. If `Foo` were\ndefined in the local crate, then all the examples would be legal.\n\n- `impl Foo for LocalType`\n- `impl<T> Foo<T> for LocalType` -- T does not appear in Self, so it is OK\n- `impl<T> Foo<T> for LocalType<T>` -- T here is constrained by LocalType\n- `impl<T> Foo<T> for (LocalType<T>, T)` -- T here is constrained by LocalType\n\nHere are some illegal examples (again, these examples assume that\n`Foo` is not local to the current crate):\n\n- `impl Foo for int` -- the Self type is not local\n- `impl<T> Foo for T` -- T appears in Self unconstrained by a local type\n- `impl<T> Foo for (LocalType, T)` -- T appears in Self unconstrained by a local type\n\nThis is a [breaking-change]. For the time being, you can opt out of\nthe new rules by placing `#[old_orphan_check]` on the trait (and\nenabling the feature gate where the trait is defined). Longer term,\nyou should restructure your traits to avoid the problem. Usually this\nmeans changing the order of parameters so that the \"central\" type\nparameter is in the `Self` position.\n\nAs an example of that refactoring, consider the `BorrowFrom` trait:\n\n```rust\npub trait BorrowFrom<Sized? Owned> for Sized? {\n    fn borrow_from(owned: &Owned) -> &Self;\n}\n```\n\nAs defined, this trait is commonly implemented for custom pointer\ntypes, such as `Arc`. Those impls follow the pattern:\n\n```rust\nimpl<T> BorrowFrom<Arc<T>> for T {...}\n```\n\nUnfortunately, this impl is illegal because the self type `T` is not\nlocal to the current crate. Therefore, we are going to change the order of the parameters,\nso that `BorrowFrom` becomes `Borrow`:\n\n```rust\npub trait Borrow<Sized? Borrowed> for Sized? {\n    fn borrow_from(owned: &Self) -> &Borrowed;\n}\n```\n\nNow the `Arc` impl is written:\n\n```rust\nimpl<T> Borrow<T> for Arc<T> { ... }\n```\n\nThis impl is legal because the self type (`Arc<T>`) is local."

    "message": "auto merge of #20578 : japaric/rust/no-more-bc, r=nmatsakis\n\nThis PR removes boxed closures from the language, the closure type syntax (`let f: |int| -> bool = /* ... */`) has been obsoleted. Move all your uses of closures to the new unboxed closure system (i.e. `Fn*` traits).\r\n\r\n[breaking-change] patterns\r\n\r\n- `lef f = || {}`\r\n\r\nThis binding used to type check to a boxed closure. Now that boxed closures are gone, you need to annotate the \"kind\" of the unboxed closure, i.e. you need pick one of these: `|&:| {}`, `|&mut:| {}` or `|:| {}`.\r\n\r\nIn the (near) future we'll have closure \"kind\" inference, so the compiler will infer which `Fn*` trait to use based on how the closure is used. Once this inference machinery is in place, we'll be able to remove the kind annotation from most closures.\r\n\r\n- `type Alias<'a> = |int|:'a -> bool`\r\n\r\nUse a trait object: `type Alias<'a> = Box<FnMut(int) -> bool + 'a>`. Use the `Fn*` trait that makes sense for your use case.\r\n\r\n- `fn foo(&self, f: |uint| -> bool)`\r\n\r\nIn this case you can use either a trait object or an unboxed closure:\r\n\r\n``` rust\r\nfn foo(&self, f: F) where F: FnMut(uint) -> bool;\r\n// or\r\nfn foo(&self, f: Box<FnMut(uint) -> bool>);\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `struct Struct<'a> { f: |uint|:'a -> bool }`\r\n\r\nAgain, you can use either a trait object or an unboxed closure:\r\n\r\n``` rust\r\nstruct Struct<F> where F: FnMut(uint) -> bool { f: F }\r\n// or\r\nstruct Struct<'a> { f: Box<FnMut(uint) -> bool + 'a> }\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Using `|x, y| f(x, y)` for closure \"borrows\"\r\n\r\nThis comes up in recursive functions, consider the following (contrived) example:\r\n\r\n``` rust\r\nfn foo(x: uint, f: |uint| -> bool) -> bool {\r\n    //foo(x / 2, f) && f(x)  // can't use this because `f` gets moved away in the `foo` call\r\n    foo(x / 2, |x| f(x)) && f(x)  // instead \"borrow\" `f` in the `foo` call\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to do the same with unboxed closures you'll hit \"\"error: reached the recursion limit during monomorphization\" (see #19596):\r\n\r\n``` rust\r\nfn foo<F>(x: uint, mut f: F) -> bool where F: FnMut(uint) -> bool {\r\n    foo(x / 2, |x| f(x)) && f(x)\r\n    //~^ error: reached the recursion limit during monomorphization\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead you *should* be able to write this:\r\n\r\n``` rust\r\nfn foo<F>(x: uint, mut f: F) -> bool where F: FnMut(uint) -> bool {\r\n    foo(x / 2, &mut f) && f(x)\r\n    //~^ error: the trait `FnMut` is not implemented for the type `&mut F`\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut as you see above `&mut F` doesn't implement the `FnMut` trait. `&mut F` *should* implement the `FnMut` and the above code *should* work, but due to a bug (see #18835) it doesn't (for now).\r\n\r\nYou can work around the issue by rewriting the function to take `&mut F` instead of `F`:\r\n\r\n``` rust\r\nfn foo<F>(x: uint, f: &mut F) -> bool where F: FnMut(uint) -> bool {\r\n    foo(x / 2, f) && (*f)(x)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis finally works! However writing `foo(0, &mut |x| x == 0)` is unergonomic. So you can use a private helper function to avoid this:\r\n\r\n``` rust\r\n// public API function\r\npub fn foo<F>(x: uint, mut f: F) -> bool where F: FnMut(uint) -> bool {\r\n    foo_(x, &mut f)\r\n}\r\n\r\n// private helper function\r\nfn foo_<F>(x: uint, f: &mut F) -> bool where F: FnMut(uint) -> bool {\r\n    foo_(x / 2, f) && (*f)(x)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCloses #14798\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere is more cleanup to do: like renaming functions/types from `unboxed_closure` to just `closure`, removing more dead code, simplify functions which now have unused arguments, update the documentation, etc. But that can be done in another PR.\r\n\r\nr? @nikomatsakis @aturon (You probably want to focus on the deleted/modified tests.)\r\ncc @eddyb"

The new rules require that, for an impl of a trait defined\nin some other crate, two conditions must hold:\n\n1. Some type must be local.\n2. Every type parameter must appear \"under\" some local type.\n\nHere are some examples that are legal:\n\n```rust\nstruct MyStruct<T> { ... }\n\n// Here `T` appears \"under' `MyStruct`.\nimpl<T> Clone for MyStruct<T> { }\n\n// Here `T` appears \"under' `MyStruct` as well. Note that it also appears\n// elsewhere.\nimpl<T> Iterator<T> for MyStruct<T> { }\n```\n\nHere is an illegal example:\n\n```rust\n// Here `U` does not appear \"under\" `MyStruct` or any other local type.\n// We call `U` \"uncovered\".\nimpl<T,U> Iterator<U> for MyStruct<T> { }\n```\n\nThere are a couple of ways to rewrite this last example so that it is\nlegal:\n\n1. In some cases, the uncovered type parameter (here, `U`) should be converted\n   into an associated type. This is however a non-local change that requires access\n   to the original trait. Also, associated types are not fully baked.\n2. Add `U` as a type parameter of `MyStruct`:\n   ```rust\n   struct MyStruct<T,U> { ... }\n   impl<T,U> Iterator<U> for MyStruct<T,U> { }\n   ```\n3. Create a newtype wrapper for `U`\n   ```rust\n   impl<T,U> Iterator<Wrapper<U>> for MyStruct<T,U> { }\n   ```\n\nBecause associated types are not fully baked, which in the case of the\n`Hash` trait makes adhering to this rule impossible, you can\ntemporarily disable this rule in your crate by using\n`#![feature(old_orphan_check)]`. Note that the `old_orphan_check`\nfeature will be removed before 1.0 is released."

Syntax extensions will break.\r\n\r\n[breaking-change]\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR removes pretty much all the remaining uses of boxed closures from the libraries. There are still boxed closures under the `test` directory, but I think those should be removed or replaced with unboxed closures at the same time we remove boxed closures from the language.\r\n\r\nIn a few places I had to do some contortions (see the first commit for an example) to work around issue #19596. I have marked those workarounds with FIXMEs. In the future when `&mut F where F: FnMut` implements the `FnMut` trait, we should be able to remove those workarounds. I've take care to avoid placing the workaround functions in the public API.\r\n\r\nSince `let f = || {}` always gets type checked as a boxed closure, I have explictly annotated those closures (with e.g. `|&:| {}`) to force the compiler to type check them as unboxed closures.\r\n\r\nInstead of removing the type aliases (like `GetCrateDataCb`), I could have replaced them with newtypes. But this seemed like overcomplicating things for little to no gain.\r\n\r\nI think we should be able to remove the boxed closures from the languge after this PR lands.
